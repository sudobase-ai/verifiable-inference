They cannot be divided evenly by any other number except 1 and themselves, making them unique and essential components of the number system. Prime numbers play a crucial role in various mathematical concepts such as factorization, modular arithmetic, cryptography, and prime number sequences. In addition to their practical applications, prime numbers also hold aesthetic value due to their inherent beauty and simplicity.\n \nFor example, prime numbers are often used in art and design for creating visually appealing patterns or symmetrical arrangements. The famous artist M.C. Escher is known for his intricate and mesmerizing works that heavily feature prime numbers as a central theme. Furthermore, prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians throughout history due to their mysterious and intriguing properties, leading to numerous theorems and conjectures being formulated by number theorists over time.\n \nIn summary, prime numbers are essential in Mathematics because they form the foundation of all other numbers, serve practical purposes such as factorization and modular arithmetic, and have aesthetic value through their inherent beauty and simplicity.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[18233,25,48605,262,12085,286,6994,3146,287,19473,628,23998,25,220,198,5537,3146,389,2383,287,39448,780,484,1296,262,2615,7021,329,477,584,3146,13,1119,2314,307,9086,21894,416,597,584,1271,2845,220,16,290,2405,11,1642,606,3748,290,6393,6805,286,262,1271,1080,13,5537,3146,711,257,8780,2597,287,2972,18069,10838,884,355,5766,1634,11,26507,34768,11,45898,11,290,6994,1271,16311,13,554,3090,284,511,8472,5479,11,6994,3146,635,1745,19713,1988,2233,284,511,11519,8737,290,21654,13,198,220,198,1890,1672,11,6994,3146,389,1690,973,287,1242,290,1486,329,4441,22632,16403,7572,393,23606,34546,14752,13,383,5863,6802,337,13,34,13,16319,372,318,1900,329,465,28746,290,46814,2890,2499,326,7272,3895,6994,3146,355,257,4318,7505,13,11399,11,6994,3146,423,30103,33161,1547,3690,2106,2233,284,511,11428,290,19827,6608,11,3756,284,6409,262,382,907,290,37262,942,852,34391,416,1271,33142,625,640,13,198,220,198,818,10638,11,6994,3146,389,6393,287,39448,780,484,1296,262,8489,286,477,584,3146,11,4691,8472,4959,884,355,5766,1634,290,26507,34768,11,290,423,19713,1988,832,511,11519,8737,290,21654,13],"total_duration":32017478440,"load_duration":8344811,"prompt_eval_count":14,"prompt_eval_duration":141000000,"eval_count":222,"eval_duration":31867000000}},"signature":"76cd02ce459e36479516eb99d29064a369ddd3b7a196c6fcdea0eef1b9a12f7538d119ce3bfdc4c3400bbdfa845160c2f607f834a481769245f1cee1fdb646e31c","recovered_address":"0xFCAd0B19bB29D4674531d6f115237E16AfCE377c"}
